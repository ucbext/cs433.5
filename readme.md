CompSci 433.5
-------------
This repository houses the code and scaffolding that UC Berkeley Extension students taking CS 433.5
use when completing their assignments.

Starter Code
------------
This repository contains various pieces of starter code that provide a skeleton and will help you
get started on your assignments. When working with this starter code, please remember that you may
not change or delete:

- Any of the code or tests already present
- Any of the interfaces, APIs, or methods already present

Supported Languages
-------------------
Quite a bit of work goes into preparing the course and the repository to use a particular language
(e.g. starter code, unit tests, solutions, etc). Currently, this course is offered in the following
languages. Other languages may be offered in the future.

- TODO: fill this in

Student Setup
-------------
In order to set up your environment, follow the setup instructions in the [Student
Setup](https://github.com/fsareshwala/cs433.5/blob/master/student-setup.md) guide.

Pulling In New Changes
----------------------
From time to time, I make changes in the upstream repository. You should pull these down into your
fork of the upstream repository. To do so, run `tools/update.sh` from the top level repository root.
This script will issue a series of `git` commands and merge the upstream changes with your local
changes. Remember to push the newly added changes to your GitHub fork as well. If you prefer, you
may use a GUI `git` client to simply fetch from the remote repository and merge automatically.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------
Submit your work by committing your changes and pushing them upstream before the due date.

Grading
-------
Each program description will include a command that will be used to run tests for the code you
write in each assignment. The percentage of tests that pass will be your final grade for the
assignment.

Contributing
------------
If you find any issues within this repository while completing your assignments, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/fsareshwala/cs433.5/issues/new) in the issue tracker. Better yet, please
open a pull request against the repository and I will be happy to merge it in.
